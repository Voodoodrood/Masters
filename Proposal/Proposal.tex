\section{Introduction}
\section{Background Reading}
\subsection{Terrain Synthesis} 
Virtual landscapes are an important component in representing natural environments for applications such as computer games, film, simulation and training\cite{Gain2015}. The subject of fast and realistic terrain synthesis has been the subject of considerable study with a variety of techniques such as patch or texture based \cite{Cruz2015, Tasse2012}, noise synthesis\cite{Musgrave1989} and erosion simulation\cite{Anh2007}. With advances in graphics processing technology we are able to simulate terrain that is indistinguishable from real terrain examples\cite{Gain2015}. 

 Gain et al.'s terrain synthesis system allows users to introduce constraints into the terrain synthesis process using a number of tools\cite{Gain2015}. The ability to add and modify geometric constraint points and curves to a landscape allows users to create landscape features such as hills, ridges and valleys.  Coherence controls allow users to fix parts of the landscape preventing later changes elsewhere from affecting it. Copy/paste functionality allows landscape regions to be moved to new locations and elevations. Type constraints which can be painted onto the landscape to define areas of a certain type such as 'swamp', 'dirt' etc. To interact with these tools users have access to a combination of sketching, painting and 3D widget interface elements. As this software will form the basis for the application being created in this study we will need to reproduce and modify these tools for use in VEs.

Additionally, we will need to take advantage of a first person view (FPV) state for editing the terrain from a FPV. Tasse et al.'s paper on first person terrain editing presents a sketch based technique which allows users to  edit terrain from a single point of view\cite{Tasse2014}. Also of note is that, although there is focus on editing the terrain from a FPV, the users requested the ability to have a separate viewpoint from which to see their changes made in the FPV. In the paper itself we are regularly given a top view to display how the changes affected the terrain as a whole. This reinforces the need to give users both an immersive FPV and a remote top-view.
\subsection{Navigation in Virtual Environments}
User navigation and viewpoint motion control techniques in VEs is the subject of a number of studies. Bowman et al. have presented a categorization of such techniques in their 1997 paper\cite{Bowman1997}. This allows us to categorize a number of techniques into two broad categories: Gaze directed navigation and tool directed navigation. Gaze directed navigation refers to instances where the user's navigation is controlled via a tracked HMD while tool directed navigation involves the user controlling their direction of movement through a hand held tool. Bowman et al. then performed a series of experiments where they found that tool directed navigation was faster than gaze directed navigation for navigating relative to objects and equal for navigating in absolute space.

Other areas of research in Navigation in Virtual Environments include investigation into the effectiveness of various types of landmarks. These included a study into whether users orientate themselves via local or global landmarks\cite{Steck2000}. Steck et al. found that although users would alternate between using local and global landmarks in certain situations they tended not to combine them. They suggest that users will tend to use the most visually distinct land marks and will prefer to use landmarks that are not occluded. This implies that navigation interface design should provide a variety of landmarks, both global and local, that allow the user to always have a distinctive point of reference. It also suggests that global landmarks that will not be occluded by local geometry should be used. A good example of this would be a static sun-like object in the sky.

Darken et al. compared a variety of tools for navigation in VEs including landmarks, breadcrumb markers and map views amongst others\cite{Darken1993}. They associated their techniques with natural human and avian  navigational behaviours. While they did not evaluate the effectiveness of the different techniques they did detail the common behaviour of the test subjects for each technique. By observing which techniques lead to simple or complex behaviour we can surmise which techniques are effective from at least an ease of use perspective. They found that the map view in particular allowed for very simple behaviour although they suggested that this was linked to the navigation space being a 2D plane. Users also were able to follow a simple sequence of actions in a scenario where they were able to fly vertically which let them observe the navigational space from above at a distant perspective. They also found that while landmarks were effective for distinguishing certain areas they provided little directional information. When they added a synthetic sun in the test case with landmarks which provided orientation information user performance increased significantly.

Darken et al.'s experiments reinforce the concept of a combination of local and global landmarks being useful for navigation. Additionally, the ease of use of both the map and the flying technique suggest that allowing the user to move in 3 dimensions and providing a 3D map will aid navigation considerably. 
\subsection{Interface design for HMDs}
In addition to research into navigation in VEs there has been substantial research into how to effectively interact with them. These interactions can be divided into two types, direct interaction with the environment and interaction with the interface.

 Interaction with environment involves the user making changes to the VE through selection and manipulation of objects. To do this users should, at minimum, be able to either select or position or rotate objects\cite{Bowman2001}. Research in this area addresses both the wide range of hardware devices created for interacting the VEs as well as the related software solutions. Common tools include a motion tracked glove [citation here] and pen or wand controllers. With regards to the software solutions a number of 3D widgets haven been implemented and tested [examples and citations here].
 
 There are a number of interesting general results from these experiments. It is widely agreed that humans are better able to judge relative position of their hands than absolute position \cite{Bowman1998, Buxton1986}. Therefore interfaces should be designed for bi-manual interaction and motion should be tracked with the dominant hand relative to the non-dominant hand. Studies also suggest that degrees of freedom (DOF) should be restricted as much as possible to simplify interaction with the VE.
 
 Interaction with the interface refers to the user modifying the state of the system or the mode of interaction\cite{Bowman2001}. Typical examples include menu interaction and tool selection. These tasks, which are often 2D or 1D are ill suited to 3D environments\cite{Bowman2001}. Mine et al. created custom 3D controllers using a combination of touch screens and physical buttons. \cite{Mine2014} These were well suited for menu selections as the 2D touch surface mapped directly to 2D interface elements. From this we can surmise that finding an alternative to motion tracking for interface interaction is advisable.
