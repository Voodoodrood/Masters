abstract = {Virtual environments show great promise in the area of training. Although such synthetic environments project homeomorphic physical representations of real- world layouts, it is not known how individuals develop models to match such environments. To evaluate this process, the present experiment examined the accuracy of triadic representations of objects having learned them previously under different conditions. The layout consisted of four different colored spheres arranged on a flat plane. These objects could be viewed in either a free navigation virtual environment condition (NAV) or a single body position virtual environment condition. The first condition allowed active exploration of the environment while the latter condition allowed the participant only a passive opportunity to observe from a single viewpoint. These viewing conditions were a between-subject variable with ten participants randomly assigned to each condition. Performance was assessed by the response latency to judge the accuracy of a layout of three objects over different rotations. Results showed linear increases in response latency as the rotation angle increased from the initial perspective in SBP condition. The NAV condition did not show a similar effect of rotation angle. These results suggest that the spatial knowledge acquisition from virtual environments through navigation is similar to actual navigation.},

Results indicate that "pointing" techniques are advantageous relative to "gaze-directed" steering techniques for a relative motion task, and that motion techniques which instantly teleport users to new locations are correlated with increased user disorientation.},

Additionally, compass information or a global frame of reference was provided by global landmarks (hilltop, television tower, and city skyline). According to participants' movement decisions, egomotion was simulated, and displayed on a 180 deg. projection screen. Participants learned the route back and forth between two local landmarks.

abstract = {Building a real-world immersive 3D modeling application is hard. In spite of the many supposed advantages of working in the virtual world, users quickly tire of waving their arms about and the resulting models remain simplistic at best. The dream of creation at the speed of thought has largely remained unfulfilled due to numerous factors such as the lack of suitable menu and system controls, inability to perform precise manipulations, lack of numeric input, challenges with ergonomics, and difficulties with maintaining user focus and preserving immersion. The focus of our research is on the building of virtual world applications that can go beyond the demo and can be used to do real-world work. The goal is to develop interaction techniques that support the richness and complexity required to build complex 3D models, yet minimize expenditure of user energy and maximize user comfort. We present an approach that combines the natural and intuitive power of VR interaction, the precision and control of 2D touch surfaces, and the richness of a commercial modeling package. We also discuss the benefits of collocating 2D touch with 3D bimanual spatial input, the challenges in designing a custom controller targeted at achieving the same, and the new avenues that this collocation creates.},

As in usual artistic pictures, the input sketch depicts complex silhouettes with cusps and T-junctions, which typically correspond to non-planar curves in 3D. After analysing depth constraints in the sketch based on perceptual cues, our method best matches the sketched silhouettes with silhouettes or ridges of the input terrain. A specific deformation algorithm is then applied to the terrain, enabling it to exactly match the sketch from the given perspective view, while insuring that none of the user-defined silhouettes is hidden by another part of the terrain. As our results show, this method enables users to easily personalize an existing terrain, while preserving its plausibility and style.},

This map-based user interface does not give fine control over the height profile of the generated terrain.We propose a newtexture-based terrain synthesis framework controllable by a terrain sketching interface.We enhance the realism of the generated landscapes by using a novel patch merging method that reduces boundary artefacts caused by overlapping terrain patches. A more constrained synthesis process is used to produce landscapes that better match user requirements. The high computational cost of texture synthesis is reduced with a parallel implementation on graphics hardware. OurGPU-accelerated solution provides a significant speedup depending on the size of the example terrain. We show experimentally that our framework is more successful in generating realistic landscapes than current example-based terrain synthesis methods. We conclude that texture-based terrain synthesis combined with sketching provides an excellent solution to the user control and realism challenges of virtual landscape generation.},

@article{Musgrave1989,
abstract = {In standard fractal terrain models based on fractional Brownian motion the statistical character of the surface is, by design, the same everywhere. A new approach to the synthesis of fractal terrain height fields is presented which, in contrast to previous techniques, features locally independent control of the frequencies composing the surface, and thus local control of fractal dimension and other statistical characteristics. The new technique, termed noise synthesis, is intermediate in difficulty of implementation, between simple stochastic subdivision and Fourier filtering or generalized stochastic subdivision, and does not suffer the drawbacks of creases or periodicity. Varying the local crossover scale of fractal character or the fractal dimension with altitude or other functions yields more realistic first approximations to eroded landscapes. A simple physical erosion model is then suggested which simulates hydraulic and thermal erosion processes to create gloabl stream/valley networks and talus slopes. Finally, an efficient ray tracing algorithm for general height fields, of which most fractal terrains are a subset, is presented.},

While there are many algorithms already developed to improve the visual quality of terrain, the recent simulation methods revolve around physically-based hydraulic erosion because it can generate realistic natural-looking terrains. However, many of such algo- rithms were tested only on low resolution terrains. When simu- lated on a higher resolution terrain, most of the current algorithms become computationally expensive. This is why in many applica- tions today, terrains are generated off-line and loaded during the application runtime.

For example, our first issue suggests that users have difficulty understanding three-dimensional space.We offer a set of strategies which may help users to better perceive a 3D virtual environment, including the use of spatial references, relative gesture, two-handed interaction, multisensory feedback, physical constraints, and head tracking.We describe interfaces which employ these strategies.

Two user studies demonstrated the effectiveness of the two-handed interface in fundamental 3D object manipulation and viewpoint manipulation tasks. Trained participants docked and constructed 3D objects 4.5-4.7 times as fast as a standard mouse interface and 1.3-2.5 times as fast as a standard one-handed wand interface. 19 of 20 participants preferred the two-handed interface over the mouse and wand interfaces. 16 participants felt very comfortable with the two-handed interface and 4 felt comfortable. No statistically significant differences in performance were found between monoscopic and stereoscopic displays although 17 of 20 participants preferred the stereoscopic display over the monoscopic display.},

In addition, this format helps reduce the effect of common tracking and system latency errors. The off-axis perspective projection techniques we use are shown to be simple and straightforward. Our techniques for doing multi-screen stereo vision are enumerated, and design barriers, past and current, are described. Advantages and disadvantages of the projection paradigm are discussed, with an analysis of the effect of tracking noise and delay on the user. Successive refinement, a necessary tool for scientific visualization, is developed in the virtual reality context. The use of the CAVE as a one-to-many presentation device at SIGGRAPH '92 and Supercomputing '92 for computational science data is also mentioned.},

abstract = {Virtual Reality (VR) has been constantly evolving since its early days, and is now a fundamental technology in different application areas. User evaluation is a crucial step in the design and development of VR systems that do respond to users' needs, as well as for identifying applications that indeed gain from the use of such technology. Yet, there is not much work reported concerning usability evaluation and validation of VR systems, when compared with the traditional desktop setup. The paper presents a user study performed, as a first step, for the evaluation of a low-cost VR system using a Head-Mounted Display (HMD). That system was compared to a traditional desktop setup through an experiment that assessed user performance, when carrying out navigation tasks in a game scenario for a short period. The results show that, although users were generally satisfied with the VR system, and found the HMD interaction intuitive and natural, most performed better with the desktop setup.

We present on-and-above-the-surface interaction techniques following Guiard's asymmetric bimanual model to take advantage of the continuous interaction space for creating and editing 3D models in a stereoscopic environment. To allow for more expressive interactions, our approach continuously combines hand and finger tracking in the space above the table with multi-touch on its surface. This combination brings forth an alternative design environment where users can seamlessly switch between interacting on the surface or in the space above it depending on the task. Our approach integrates continuous space usage with bimanual interaction to provide an expressive set of 3D modeling operations. Preliminary trials with our experimental setup show this as a very promising avenue for further work.},

abstract = {Within an embodied cognition framework, it is argued that presence in a virtual environment (VE) develops from the construction of a spatial-functional mental model of the VE. Two cognitive processes lead to this model: the representation of bodily actions as possible actions in the VE, and the suppression of incompatible sensory input. It is hypothesized that the conscious sense of presence reflects these two components as spatial presence and involvement. This prediction was con- firmed in two studies (N = 246 and N = 296) assessing self-reports of presence and immersion experiences. Additionally, judgments of “realness” were observed as a third presence component. A second-order factor analysis showed a distinction between presence, immersion, and interaction factors. Building on these results, a thirteen-item presence scale consisting of three independent components was de- veloped and verified using confirmatory factor analyses across the two studies. Presence is a construct, a variable with various levels and dimensions. Biocca and Delaney (1995, p. 62)},

abstract = {This paper evaluates three distinct metaphors for exploration and virtual camera control in virtual environments using a six degree of freedom input device. The metaphors are 'eyeball in hand', 'scene in hand', and 'flying vehicle control'. These metaphors have been implemented and evaluated using an IRIS workstation and a Polhemus 3Space. The system has the capability to record the motion path followed during and exploration session and this can be recorded and played back to create a movie. Evaluation is through intensive structured interview sessions wherein subjects are required to complete a number of tasks involving three different 'toy' environments. None of the metaphors is judged the best in all situations, rather the different metaphors each have advantages and disadvantages depending on the particular task. For example, 'scene in hand' is judged to be good for manipulating closed objects, but is not good for moving through an interior; whereas 'flying vehicle control' is judged the best for navigating through the interior, but is poor for moving around a closed object.},

@article{Duval2014,
abstract = {The feeling of presence is essential for efficient interaction within Virtual Environments (VEs). When a user is fully immersed within a VE through a large immersive display system, his/her feeling of presence can be altered because of disturbing interactions with his/her physical environment, such as collision with hardware parts of the system or loss of tracking. This alteration can be avoided by taking into account the physical features of the user as well as those of the system hardware and embedding them in the VE. Moreover, the 3D abstract representation of these physical features can also be useful for collaboration between distant users because they can make a user aware of the physical limitations of the others he/she is collaborating with. In this paper we present how we use the Immersive Interactive Virtual Cabin (IIVC) model to obtain this virtual representation of the user's physical environment and we illustrate how this representation can be used in a collaborative navigation task in a VE. We also present how we can add 3D representations of 2D interaction tools in order to cope with asymmetrical collaborative configurations, providing 3D cues for a user to understand the actions of the others even if he/she is not fully immersed in the shared VE. Last, we briefly explain how we plan to enhance 3D interaction and collaboration by embedding a symbolic 3D user representation that will give 3D information about his/her posture. {\textcopyright} 2013 OpenInterface Association.},

abstract = {In recent years, many systems have been developed for the real-time display of very large terrains. While many of these techniques combine high-quality rendering with impressive performance, most make the fundamental assumption that the terrain is represented by a faced height map that cannot be altered at run time. Such systems frequently rely on extensive preprocessing of the raw terrain data. They are mostly designed for maximum performance. Consequently, these techniques are ill-suited for the many applications such as geological simulations and games in which terrain surfaces must be altered interactively. We present a two-component system that can achieve real-time view-dependent rendering while allowing on-line multiresolution alterations of a large terrain. Our fundamental height map representation is a wavelet quadtree hierarchy, allowing one to easily apply arbitrary multiresolution edits to the terrain. Our display algorithm extracts a view-dependent approximation of the terrain from the wavelet quadtree in real time. The algorithm dynamically alters this approximation based on any ongoing edits. To allow for flexibility and to limit performance loss, the two components of this system have been designed to be as independent as possible. {\textcopyright} 2006 The Eurographics Association and Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

@article{Vanek2011,
abstract = {Physics-based approaches could simplify terrain modeling by increasing its realism. However, most simulations provide only a low level of user control because they fail on large-scale phenomena or focus only on the modeling of limited effects. A new physics-based system for digital terrain editing is suitable for digital-content authors such as game designers, artists, and 3D modelers. It doesn't assume in-depth knowledge about physics-based simulations. Users can load large terrains from external sources, generate them procedurally, or create them manually, and they can edit them at interactive frame rates on a GPU. To allow large-scale editing, the system divides terrain into tiles of different resolutions according to the terrain's complexity, and it stores each tile as a mip-map texture. In addition, the physics-based simulation uses different levels of detail, depending on the terrain-change dynamics. Compared to nonadaptive computation, this approach can achieve 50 percent speedup and use 25 percent less memory. The Web extra is a video that shows how physics-based approaches to modeling can process terrain sizes larger than what was previously possible.},

abstract = {Previous terrain rendering approaches have addressed the aspect of data compression and fast decoding for rendering, but applications where the terrain is repeatedly modified and needs to be buffered on disk have not been considered so far. Such applications require both decoding and encoding to be faster than disk transfer. We present a novel approach for editing gigasample terrain fields at interactive rates and high quality. To achieve high decoding and encoding throughput, we employ a compression scheme for height and pixel maps based on a sparse wavelet representation. On recent GPUs it can encode and decode up to 270 and 730 MPix/s of color data, respectively, at compression rates and quality superior to JPEG, and it achieves more than twice these rates for lossless height field compression. The construction and rendering of a height field triangulation is avoided by using GPU ray-casting directly on the regular grid underlying the compression scheme. We show the efficiency of our method for interactive editing and continuous level-of-detail rendering of terrain fields comprised of several hundreds of gigasamples.},

These features can be interactively edited, and the landscape can be explored in real time at any altitude from flight view to car view. We use vector descriptions of linear and areal features, with associated shaders to specify their appearance (terrain color and material), their footprint (effect on terrain shape), and their associated objects (bridges, hedges, etc.). In order to encompass both very large terrains and very fine details we rely on a view dependent quadtree refinement scheme. New quads are generated when needed and cached on the GPU. For each quad we produce on the GPU an appearance texture, a footprint texture, and some object meshes, based on the features vector description and their associated shaders. Adaptive refinement, procedural vector features and a mipmap pyramid provide three LOD mechanisms for small, medium and large scale quads. Our results and attached video show high performance with high visual quality.},
