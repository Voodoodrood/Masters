abstract = {Virtual environments show great promise in the area of training. Although such synthetic environments project homeomorphic physical representations of real- world layouts, it is not known how individuals develop models to match such environments. To evaluate this process, the present experiment examined the accuracy of triadic representations of objects having learned them previously under different conditions. The layout consisted of four different colored spheres arranged on a flat plane. These objects could be viewed in either a free navigation virtual environment condition (NAV) or a single body position virtual environment condition. The first condition allowed active exploration of the environment while the latter condition allowed the participant only a passive opportunity to observe from a single viewpoint. These viewing conditions were a between-subject variable with ten participants randomly assigned to each condition. Performance was assessed by the response latency to judge the accuracy of a layout of three objects over different rotations. Results showed linear increases in response latency as the rotation angle increased from the initial perspective in SBP condition. The NAV condition did not show a similar effect of rotation angle. These results suggest that the spatial knowledge acquisition from virtual environments through navigation is similar to actual navigation.},

Additionally, compass information or a global frame of reference was provided by global landmarks (hilltop, television tower, and city skyline). According to participants' movement decisions, egomotion was simulated, and displayed on a 180 deg. projection screen. Participants learned the route back and forth between two local landmarks.

abstract = {Building a real-world immersive 3D modeling application is hard. In spite of the many supposed advantages of working in the virtual world, users quickly tire of waving their arms about and the resulting models remain simplistic at best. The dream of creation at the speed of thought has largely remained unfulfilled due to numerous factors such as the lack of suitable menu and system controls, inability to perform precise manipulations, lack of numeric input, challenges with ergonomics, and difficulties with maintaining user focus and preserving immersion. The focus of our research is on the building of virtual world applications that can go beyond the demo and can be used to do real-world work. The goal is to develop interaction techniques that support the richness and complexity required to build complex 3D models, yet minimize expenditure of user energy and maximize user comfort. We present an approach that combines the natural and intuitive power of VR interaction, the precision and control of 2D touch surfaces, and the richness of a commercial modeling package. We also discuss the benefits of collocating 2D touch with 3D bimanual spatial input, the challenges in designing a custom controller targeted at achieving the same, and the new avenues that this collocation creates.},

As in usual artistic pictures, the input sketch depicts complex silhouettes with cusps and T-junctions, which typically correspond to non-planar curves in 3D. After analysing depth constraints in the sketch based on perceptual cues, our method best matches the sketched silhouettes with silhouettes or ridges of the input terrain. A specific deformation algorithm is then applied to the terrain, enabling it to exactly match the sketch from the given perspective view, while insuring that none of the user-defined silhouettes is hidden by another part of the terrain. As our results show, this method enables users to easily personalize an existing terrain, while preserving its plausibility and style.},

This map-based user interface does not give fine control over the height profile of the generated terrain.We propose a newtexture-based terrain synthesis framework controllable by a terrain sketching interface.We enhance the realism of the generated landscapes by using a novel patch merging method that reduces boundary artefacts caused by overlapping terrain patches. A more constrained synthesis process is used to produce landscapes that better match user requirements. The high computational cost of texture synthesis is reduced with a parallel implementation on graphics hardware. OurGPU-accelerated solution provides a significant speedup depending on the size of the example terrain. We show experimentally that our framework is more successful in generating realistic landscapes than current example-based terrain synthesis methods. We conclude that texture-based terrain synthesis combined with sketching provides an excellent solution to the user control and realism challenges of virtual landscape generation.},

@article{Musgrave1989,
abstract = {In standard fractal terrain models based on fractional Brownian motion the statistical character of the surface is, by design, the same everywhere. A new approach to the synthesis of fractal terrain height fields is presented which, in contrast to previous techniques, features locally independent control of the frequencies composing the surface, and thus local control of fractal dimension and other statistical characteristics. The new technique, termed noise synthesis, is intermediate in difficulty of implementation, between simple stochastic subdivision and Fourier filtering or generalized stochastic subdivision, and does not suffer the drawbacks of creases or periodicity. Varying the local crossover scale of fractal character or the fractal dimension with altitude or other functions yields more realistic first approximations to eroded landscapes. A simple physical erosion model is then suggested which simulates hydraulic and thermal erosion processes to create gloabl stream/valley networks and talus slopes. Finally, an efficient ray tracing algorithm for general height fields, of which most fractal terrains are a subset, is presented.},

While there are many algorithms already developed to improve the visual quality of terrain, the recent simulation methods revolve around physically-based hydraulic erosion because it can generate realistic natural-looking terrains. However, many of such algo- rithms were tested only on low resolution terrains. When simu- lated on a higher resolution terrain, most of the current algorithms become computationally expensive. This is why in many applica- tions today, terrains are generated off-line and loaded during the application runtime.

For example, our first issue suggests that users have difficulty understanding three-dimensional space.We offer a set of strategies which may help users to better perceive a 3D virtual environment, including the use of spatial references, relative gesture, two-handed interaction, multisensory feedback, physical constraints, and head tracking.We describe interfaces which employ these strategies. Our major contribution is the synthesis of many scattered results, observations, and examples into a common framework. This framework should serve as a guide to researchers or systems builders whomay not be familiar with design issues in spatial input.Where appropriate, we also try to identify areas in free-space 3D interaction which we see as likely candidates for additional research.

These sensors are mounted on the light-weight glove and connected to the driving hardware via a small cable.Applications of the glove and its component technologies include its use in conjunction with a host computer which drives a real-time 3-dimensional model of the hand allowing the glove wearer to manipulate computer-generated objects as if they were real, interpretation of finger-spelling, evaluation of hand impairment in addition to providing an interface to a visual programming language.},

abstract = {This paper describes a two-handed interface that enables intuitive interaction with 3D multimedia environments. Two user studies demonstrated the effectiveness of the two-handed interface in fundamental 3D object manipulation and viewpoint manipulation tasks. Trained participants docked and constructed 3D objects 4.5-4.7 times as fast as a standard mouse interface and 1.3-2.5 times as fast as a standard one-handed wand interface. 19 of 20 participants preferred the two-handed interface over the mouse and wand interfaces. 16 participants felt very comfortable with the two-handed interface and 4 felt comfortable. No statistically significant differences in performance were found between monoscopic and stereoscopic displays although 17 of 20 participants preferred the stereoscopic display over the monoscopic display.},
